# ⚛️ React Serbia 🇷🇸

## About 💡

This document outlines the ideas for the React Serbia organization meetups.

React Serbia gathers React enthusiasts in order to empower them. React Serbia should be a one-stop shop for the Serbia's React community.

We aim to provide a structure for:

-   networking
-   knowledge sharing
-   ideas exchange
-   job finding
-   community growth
-   talent showcasing.

## Meetup Outlines 🗓️

The idea is to meet monthly. Meetups should have a certain structure.

Meetup agenda should be listed in advance and meetup summary should be recorded and posted publicly.

Ideas:

-   we will seek for sponsorship in order to create quality events
-   all atendees should be registered in order to properly plan the meetup
-   organize a few talks; those can be random or later focused on a certain topic
-   collect the data about atendees that are willing to be listed and publish it
-   the summary should list the people's data, GitHub, LinkedIn, email, etc.
-   the summary should list the people open to work
-   the summary should list sponsors currently hiring and open positions.
